              <p>Ok, so this was a rather vague question I asked myself when we were coming back from Mandai.</p>
<p>Instead of coming up with a solution, now we had to find a better problem to solve.<br>We also had to meet Colin the day after so we decided to shift our target audience to students, whose problems we knew better. </p>
<p>Initially the group were discussing about an idea for attendance taking, but that problem was already solved, when we spoke to Colin about it. Also the problem was that the target audience was too small, also the advantage of the teams doing games was that the target audience is already large if they can do a decent job. </p>
<p>So while we were discussing with Colin about shifting our end-users to be students instead of VWOs he suggested continuing on with the volunteering jobs idea but doing part time jobs instead. I then remembered that IVLE Student events were going to be closed down in DEC 2016, and that a lot of requests for student helpers and participants in paid experiments were listed there.</p>
<p>Seeing that there was (or was going to be) an unment need we shifted our ideas to tracking ad-hoc and part-time jobs instead. Fortunately for us we had already built the backbone of the app, so we could change it without much trouble/ wasted work, and we could present the staging version of the website for the progress report 2.</p>
<p>So the way we answered the question was to look at what was lacking currently, afterall the need was already validated for us, all we had to do was build a better version of it. To put it more abstractly, Timing. </p>
<p>This also reminds me of a TED video on <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gross_the_single_biggest_reason_why_startups_succeed" target="_blank" rel="external">the single reason why startups succeed</a>, which also argues that ‘timing’ is the reason for the success of startups. Personally I thought it was too safe a statement to make, as although generally speaking the ‘timing’ would makes sense on hindsight, every situation is different and the specific conditions that one looks out varies widely. In our case the change was a specific to IVLE and adhoc jobs on campus. But still, I thought it was apt that it was the opportunistic who exploited changes in the landscape, either situational or technical that tended to have better results.</p>

              <p>So, one thing that future batches of CS3216 students can learn from my team is that <strong>talking to your users is key</strong>. My previous blog post was listening to feedback. But all these people we talked to were not our end-users. For many apps, the users are it’s currency. And at the time of the previous post we had talked to exactly none.</p>
<p>The problem is that while the feedback may be great to hear, it wasn’t strong enough for us to change direction. On hindsight, we should have went straight to VWOs instead of linking ourselves up with people who knew VWOs and volunteers. That was exactly what we did around 4 weeks before STePS, when we went down to St. Joseph’s Home in Mandai(!), and talked to Geraldine, their volunteer manager.</p>
<p>We found out that the needs of the VWOs were more than we could accomplish in a month. It wasn’t just tracking but a whole host of other interconnected problems, from before volunteering begins, when they recruit volunteers and screen them, to after volunteering when they want to engage them. Verifying volunteers’ attendance at first seemed like a well-defined problem, but after speaking to Geraldine we realised that most volunteers don’t actually have the level of incentive that we had envisioned, and even if we could solve, that there just was not much demand.</p>
<p>There is a saying by Paul Graham that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A startup founder should be writing code and <strong>talking to users</strong>. That’s it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We got the writing code part down, but again it was <strong>talking to users</strong> that was the missing link.</p>
<p>In hindsight, maybe it was just easier not to talk to the users, I think the mentality that we as programmers (or at least I) have is that “talk is cheap” and I would rather someone just “show me the code”, which I still think is true. If only I could have convinced my past self that while that is true in programming iteslf, building a product isn’t the same thing. Other people are involved in the creation, the main and maybe only important group being users, and understanding their needs is the core of whether that creation has a reason to exist.</p>
<p>I think personally talking has always been something I was lacking in, and I’m glad at the very least CS3216 reminded me of how much I needed to improve in this aspect.</p>

              <h2 id="Getting-Feedback"><a href="#Getting-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Getting Feedback"></a>Getting Feedback</h2><p>During the past week we’ve talked to a few people, besides Colin, who were involved with our main user group, volunteers, in various ways about the idea of time credits and got some valuable feedback on the idea. </p>
<p>The first was Prof Sun Teck, who pitched his idea about reaching out to ‘at risk’ users on social media. In the end both our groups’ and his idea had different objectives, but he was willing to give us contacts to people who managed volunteers that he knew, and suggested people who were doing CIP as they may want other incentive. His group also questioned whether the time credits would de-value volunteer work, the idea that extrinsic motivation would crowd out the intrinsic motivation of the satisfaction and relationships formed through volunteering work.</p>
<p>We also contacted Mr Moh Hon Meng, founder of <a href="hoodchampions.sg">hoodchampions.sg</a>, whose <a href="blockpooling.sg">blockpooling.sg</a> was similar to our initial idea. Being on the board for the children cancer foundation, his insights were quite useful too, and he also offered to link us up with some of the volunteer managers he knew to help us test the app. From our conversation, his opinion of the nature of volunteering was that for younger volunteers it was more on an ad-hoc basis, and VWOs (Voluntary Welfare Organisations) were trying to adapt to cater to more ‘on demand’ volunteering, in contrast to long term commitments from older volunteers, and that the whole process of verification of hours volunteered was manual, tedious and a problem worth looking into as we could add real value, in terms of saving costs and increasing the volunteer pool for VWOs.</p>
<p>Also, he cautioned against doing material rewards as he felt that for volunteers the rewards were less material, and more psychological - from his experience the interaction with children, appreciation from the VWOs, also of the general trend of employers hiring based on more than grades, but also looking at things like social consciousness. Some ideas for additional rewards for VWOs, in addition to number of volunteers and exposure, from our discussion also were to improve the interaction with volunteers, like leaving messages or positive testimonials for each other. </p>
<p>Lastly, Xu Jie also contacted some of the social oriented clubs and societies in NUS, as they could be our potential users as well. Some feedback we got were that, it would be useful for VWOs although the current idea requires employers to verify the hours on our platform, also that time credits could take away the spirit of volunteerism, and tasks for helping out in your own community would be helpful.</p>
<p>From the above feedback we concluded that rewards may not be desirable, in a way it lightens our load as Colin was afraid that the marketing effort would be too much as we had to go and pitch to merchants also and the rewards that we would get may not be that attractive.</p>
<h2 id="Getting-more-Feedback"><a href="#Getting-more-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Getting more Feedback"></a>Getting more Feedback</h2><p>Still, I believe that building the prototype and getting the end-user feedback would be more important, and to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/first-rule-of-usability-dont-listen-to-users/" target="_blank" rel="external">see what they do instead of what they say</a> aka the first rule of usability. Starting usability testing asap would be useful to iron out our features, and tailor it to the problems that volunteers and VWOs would face.</p>

<p>Some UI decisions were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not using hamburger menus ( After this article about <a href="https://lmjabreu.com/post/why-and-how-to-avoid-hamburger-menus/" target="_blank" rel="external">avoiding hamburger menus</a> )</li>
<li>Guidelines for organising layout, for eg: how many buttons on the bottom bar ( we went for three ) <a href="https://material.google.com/components/bottom-navigation.html#bottom-navigation-usage" target="_blank" rel="external">Material design has some neat and specific guidelines</a></li>
<li>A question: Would the app not be simple enough for users (businesses/ volunteers) to get onboard? ( How to reduce the number of steps for businesses/ volunteers to redeem time credits - Would QR codes be a good idea? )</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideas on users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who the main target audience would be? ( Volunteers who could use a bit of incentive, charities who need volunteers, businesses interested in supporting causes ) </li>
<li>We were familiar at least with volunteering, but engaging business could be an issue</li>
<li>Would there be too many stakeholders? There’s that famous advice about <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html#f8n" target="_blank" rel="external">doing things that don’t scale</a></li>

          <span itemprop="articleBody">
            
              <p>This week while having my mid-terms I researched on the idea of time credits, which my team is planning to adapt in our final project, 1our.</p>
<p>Time Banking was initially popularized in the US by human rights lawyer Edgar Cahn in 1986, when “money for social programs dried up” and no dominant approach to social service in the US was coming up with creative ways to solve the problem, and the term ‘Time Credits’ were coined by him. The first time bank was started in Japan as early as 1973 by Teruko Mizushima, where she had foreseen problems of an ageing society in the 1940s(!). </p>
<h2 id="Time-Money"><a href="#Time-Money" class="headerlink" title="Time == Money?"></a>Time == <em>Money</em>?</h2><p>Spice <a href="http://www.justaddspice.org/about-us" target="_blank" rel="external">(justaddspice.org)</a> is based in the UK and is one of the more popular developments of the Time Credits concept, where:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>   “for each hour that an individual gives to their community or service, they earn a Time Credit. These credits can then be spent on an hour’s activity, help from another individual, or gifted to others.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given this association with time credits and social work, it may make sense to apply time credits to social work instead of just a general listing of work or odd jobs. MCI seems to have the same idea in the ICT masterplan <a href="https://www.mci.gov.sg/web/content/infocomm-media-masterplan/preliminary-ideas/enable-people-and-businesses-to-harness-the-power-of-icm/community-time-exchange" target="_blank" rel="external">preliminary ideas</a>, but it seems that it hasn’t materialized. In Singapore, it seems more volunteers are needed in some areas like <a href="http://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/ips/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/pa_Paveena_TD_More-work-needed-to-get-more-volunteers-to-help-seniors_1601151.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">the elderly</a></p>
<h2 id="Is-will-there-be-demand"><a href="#Is-will-there-be-demand" class="headerlink" title="Is / will there be demand?"></a>Is / will there be demand?</h2><p>An issue may be that people just “don’t have the time”, especially in busy Singapore. </p>
<p>With regard to volunteerism, <a href="http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/are-youth-really-not-volunteering-enough" target="_blank" rel="external">youths may not want to volunteer</a>. Still, first on the list of goals in the survey were maintaining strong relationships, and third was learning new skills and knowledge. Time credits have been shown to exactly meet these needs, and seems to me more meaningful and useful than CIP hours. </p>
<p>With 43 per cent of those aged between 15 and 24 served as volunteers in 2012, and <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/more-young-people-take-volunteerism" target="_blank" rel="external">the number rising</a>, our project may add more meaning to the somewhat top down and forced CIP volunteerism. Of note is that the rates of volunteerism drop for working adults who concentrate on building their careers, so we can probably rule them out as our main target audience.</p>
<h2 id="Time-lt-Money"><a href="#Time-lt-Money" class="headerlink" title="Time &lt; Money?"></a>Time &lt; <em>Money</em>?</h2><p>It has been found that <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/far-more-sporeans-willing-donate-volunteer" target="_blank" rel="external">most may just want to give money instead of time</a>. Again this would apply to the general working population, so maybe we should focus on people who are still studying and those who have retired, who have the most ‘free time’.</p>
<h2 id="Is-there-time-for-us"><a href="#Is-there-time-for-us" class="headerlink" title="Is there time for us?"></a>Is there time for us?</h2><p>Spice has an extensive list of partners and backing from the local government, but for our 2 month project perhaps we could focus on validating the idea instead of trying to scale it to many organisations. Some suggestions are to start small, <a href="http://theindependent.sg/will-this-work-in-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="external">with activities the community is familiar with</a></p>

              <p>As assignment 3 comes to an end, just wanna share a few options for deploying the app which was built upon the <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app" target="_blank" rel="external">create-react-app</a> boilerplate.</p>
<h1 id="The-no-backend-option"><a href="#The-no-backend-option" class="headerlink" title="The no-backend option"></a>The no-backend option</h1><p>These are mainly the options stated in the <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#deployment" target="_blank" rel="external">documentation</a>, which makes use of the build folder generated with npm build script command. There’s heroku buildpacks, modulus, now and surge.sh, and probably more being added soon. These had been useful for deploying the frontend of the app, when our backend was not ready yet.</p>
<h1 id="With-backend"><a href="#With-backend" class="headerlink" title="With backend"></a>With backend</h1><p>Deploying the backend comes with its own set of challenges. Before that, developing one to work with the webpack dev server was also a tough one, here’s a <a href="https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/" target="_blank" rel="external">tutorial that came in useful for us</a>. We eventually used Express for out backend, and it worked out quite well for us.</p>

<p>This is so that if I type in a direct url for example <a href="https://dropins.space/drops" target="_blank" rel="external">https://dropins.space/drops</a>, I won’t get a 404.</p>
<p>It sucks that heroku puts dynos to sleep, but a <em>simple</em> workaround I googled was to do:<br><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> https = <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">"https"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">setInterval(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    https.get(<span class="string">"https://dropins.space"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;, <span class="number">300000</span>); <span class="comment">// ping every 5 minutes (300000)</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>So yea, check out <a href="https://dropins.space" target="_blank" rel="external">dropins.space</a>, and phew, time to start studying for midterms.</p>

<p>As with any PWA, first make a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/11/Support-for-installable-web-apps-with-webapp-manifest-in-chrome-38-for-Android?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="external">manifest.json</a> in the root folder and link it in <code>index.html</code>, and also register the service worker that will be created by sw-precache:<br><figure class="highlight html"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">link</span> <span class="attribute">rel</span>=<span class="value">"manifest"</span> <span class="attribute">href</span>=<span class="value">"manifest.json"</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">&lt;!-- At the bottom --&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">script</span>&gt;</span><span class="actionscript"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="string">'serviceWorker'</span> <span class="keyword">in</span> navigator) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">	navigator.serviceWorker.register(<span class="string">'service-worker.js'</span>).<span class="keyword">catch</span>(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(ex)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">		console.warn(ex);</span><br><span class="line">	&#125;);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">script</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Then in the package.json under “scripts”:<br><figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">"scripts": &#123;</span><br><span class="line"> "build": "react-scripts build &amp;&amp; cp manifest.json build/ &amp;&amp; sw-precache --root='build/' --static-file-globs='build/**/!(*map*)'",</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>This creates the production build, copies the manifest.json into the build folder, runs sw-precache in the build folder and caches the static content.</p>
<p>To deploy the static build to a https I used surge.sh, assuming you’re in the root folder, I can deploy to a https domain to see it working:<br><figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">surge client/build --domain drop-dev.surge.sh</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>

              <h1 id="Emoji-Problem"><a href="#Emoji-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Emoji Problem"></a>Emoji Problem</h1><p>So my group decided on doing an app using emoji’s and mapbox, it’s Pokemon Go for chat where you (or businesses) could drop and discover messages (mockup screenshots below) around you. Well apparently you need to <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/help/custom-markers/" target="_blank" rel="external">upload images to Mapbox Studio for custom marker icons in MapboxGL</a>, the only other custom image (using css) was the user’s avartar which updated on map move rather than as a marker property. We thought we could upload all 1200+ emoji / 874 twemoji svg files and be done (they were only 1mb, why not?), but strangely there was an (AFAIK) undocumented 500 sprite limit. </p>
<h1 id="Lesser-is-better"><a href="#Lesser-is-better" class="headerlink" title="Lesser is better"></a>Lesser is better</h1><p>Anyway emojis like flags and letters would not be too relevant for our purposes, so we just had to choose which emojis we would support. Based on <a href="http://emojitracker.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://emojitracker.com/</a> we thought that using the people + objects categories (425 twemojis) would cover well enough ground for people to post their reactions and activities.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-get-the-files"><a href="#How-to-get-the-files" class="headerlink" title="How to get the files"></a>How to get the files</h1><p>The next step was to upload the svgs. To choose a subset of <a href="https://github.com/twitter/twemoji" target="_blank" rel="external">twemojis</a> to upload to Mapbox Studio and to use with <a href="https://github.com/chadoh/react-emoji-picker" target="_blank" rel="external">react-emoji-picker</a> in our app, I had to first get the list of twemojis we would support on the emoji picker. There was a category to name mapping, then there was a name to unicode mapping, put the two together and a script and tada I got the files, here’s <a href="https://github.com/leonmak/twemoji-filter" target="_blank" rel="external">the repo</a>.</p>

              <h1 id="Have-a-rival"><a href="#Have-a-rival" class="headerlink" title="Have a rival"></a>Have a rival</h1><p>The title on <a href="https://discordapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Discord’s landing page</a> is “It’s time to ditch Skype and TeamSpeak.” For gamers used to these services, it sends a clear signal that Discord is promising to do better.<br><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/leonmak/image/upload/v1472562905/Screenshot_2016-08-30_20.22.52_rrnuwn.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The group’s discussion of Discord positioning themselves as a competitor to other VOIP apps reminded me of a blog article I read about how <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/whos-your-arch-enemy/" target="_blank" rel="external">Jeff Atwood of Stack Overflow saw Experts-Exchange as its arch-enemy</a>, when he wrote </p>
<blockquote>
<p>by far the most effective way to explain what we do – is this:<br>We’re like experts-exchange, but without all the evil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel that it’s important for apps to do this especially if the technology may be foreign to some. Saying that “X is the better version of Y” is a stronger comparison than the (<em>cliched?</em>) advice associating a product as the “X of Y”. </p>
<p>Having a point of reference is easier than having to imagine an entirely new product.</p>
<p>In retrospect, personally many apps I’ve used have a similar argument, for example, NUSmods vs other calendars, NUSwhispers vs NUSconfessions, etc. even if they did not explicitly state it.</p>
<h1 id="Thoughts"><a href="#Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Thoughts"></a>Thoughts</h1><p>I feel that looking at weaker or ‘defective’ products is another way to ideate. By looking at ‘pain points’, rather than predicting users’ needs, we can find areas where demand is already present but not met. </p>
<p>To relate this to the presentation my group did about Periscope, the CEO of Meerkat (a rival app which ditched live-streaming), explains the <a href="http://www.recode.net/2016/3/4/11586696/meerkat-is-ditching-the-livestream-and-chasing-a-video-social-network" target="_blank" rel="external">challenge with using new technology like live-streaming</a> - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before Instagram, people already knew what constituted a beautiful photo and tried to take them. With live video no one really knows what ‘good’ live video they can create is.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps it also would have been a better choice to pick an app/tech that everyone in class was familiar with, as we had to spend time explaining the app to everyone.</p>
<p><em>An aside: Like Ash and Gary, rivalry is relatable</em><br><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/leonmak/image/upload/c_scale,w_270/v1472559150/Ash-and-Gary-ash-ketchum-10888934-985-615_8589_nn1bho.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="Be-the-very-best-that-no-one-ever-was"><a href="#Be-the-very-best-that-no-one-ever-was" class="headerlink" title="Be the very best, that no one ever was"></a>Be the very best, that no one ever was</h1><p>Discord also makes it very clear what they are best at - chat, and for who - gamers. From their logo being a speech bubble, to their focus on live chat (text and voice, and on different platforms), the group identified the niche that Discord targets - communication between gamers. I felt that this was an important point, as Discord understands gamers’ unique pains and offers them ‘painkillers’ - from a fuss-free setup (for non-technical gamers), voice chat that has the lowest cpu consumption doesn’t make you lag, to the in-game chat where you don’t need to switch to the chat application.<br><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/leonmak/image/upload/c_scale,w_270/v1472559368/Screenshot_2016-08-30_20.15.13_slnjxl.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Compared to services like skype and teamspeak, which cater to groups other than gamers, like business and educational content, Discord stands out clearly. Differentiating themselves clearly from their competitors and directly addressing gamer-specific needs allows Discord to quickly gain a loyal following.</p>
<h1 id="Thoughts-1"><a href="#Thoughts-1" class="headerlink" title="Thoughts"></a>Thoughts</h1><p>The founders being avid gamers themselves know their users inside out, and more than met the technical challenges of in-game communication. I feel that part of the reason why NUS apps like NUSmods and NUSwhispers have succeeded is that the developers themselves were the users and this gave them a deeper understanding of the needs of their users.</p>
<h1 id="Gotta-catch-‘em-all"><a href="#Gotta-catch-‘em-all" class="headerlink" title="Gotta catch ‘em all!"></a>Gotta catch ‘em all!</h1><p>Discord goes further than solving their users’ needs but also relates to them as gamers on an emotional level. I would argue that although this is subjective it is clear to me their users feel they are being understood. As Zhi An from the group pointed out during the Q&amp;A, from their website to the loading screen backgrounds, to small details like their cute graphics are things that are easily relatable to users who identify themselves as gamers.</p>
<p>I feel that it is important to ‘make something users love’, as the result for Discord is a user base that is very supportive of their efforts. Some even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/4d96pa/top_7_reasons_to_use_discord/" target="_blank" rel="external">encourage other gamers</a> to use Discord because they like it so much. This much desired ‘organic growth’ I think comes only when users can feel that the app is a part of their own identy that they are willing to promote it, something which discord manages to do through their love for online gaming. </p>
<p><em>Another aside: like Ash, you don’t need to catch pokemon if you can become their friends.</em><br><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/leonmak/image/upload/c_scale,w_270/v1472562906/Screenshot_2016-08-30_21.14.52_nkqyxy.png" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="Other-thoughts"><a href="#Other-thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Other thoughts"></a>Other thoughts</h1><p>I felt that some suggestions the group had about recording music and presentations diluted the main message that Discord was ‘for gamers by gamers’, and also for that reason they are unlikely to be targetting slack though their UI looks the same and some features overlap. As a gamer the key feature I would want is free and fast VOIP chat and slack really excels more for work related tasks like using integrations and file-sharing.</p>
